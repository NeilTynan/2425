    "## Part 2: *Tasks 1-7*\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Create Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 1 was to create a main directory named **data**, with two subdirectories **timestamps** and **weather**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was accomplished using the command \"mkdir data\" to create the **data** directory and then using \"mkdir data/weather\" and \"mkdir data/timestamps\" to create the two subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2 required using the \"date\" command to append the current date and time to a file named now.txt in the **timestamps** subdirectory. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the active folder was changed from the repository's root directory to **timestamps** using command \"cd ./data/timestamps\" [change directory to **timestamps**]. Then the command \"date >> now.txt\" was used to fetch today's date [\"date\"] and then to append it [\">>\"] to the file \"now.txt\" (which the command also created, as there was no existing folder called \"now.txt\" in that subdirectory). This process was then repeated 10 times using copy/paste. As the file \"now.txt\" now existed in the subdirectory, this simply led to the date appended being appeneded to the already existing file 10 more times. Finally, the command \"more now.txt\" was used to check the contents of the file \"now.txt\" in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Formatting Timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 3 was similar to task 2 but required that the date was appended in a specific format (YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently the process was largely the same as that for task 2. The only differences were that the file name was changed to \"formatted.txt\" and the command for appending the date to the file was changed to \"date+\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S >> formated.txt\". This appended the data in the required format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Create Timestamped Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 4 involved creating an empty file which had the current date/time as it's title.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this the command \"touch `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.txt\"\" was used. \"touch\" was used generate a new empty file and \"date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.txt\" was placed in backticks after it so that Bash knew that the results of this command should be the file name and that this should be calculated before the \"touch\" part of the command took place. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5: Download Today's Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 5 was to download today's weather data for Athenry and to save it into a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, as this data had to go into the weather subdirectory, this directory was navigated to using the \"cd ..\" command to go back up on directory (to **data**) and then \"cd ./weather\" was used to navigate to the **weather** subdirectory. Once in the subdirectory, used the command wget -O weather.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today to fetch the data [\"wget\"] from Met Eireann's API [\"https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\"] and then to place the results in a new file, \"weather.json\" [\"-O weather.json\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 6: Timestamp the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 6 was the same as task 5 but the filename had to include a timestamp, like with task 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command used this time was \"wget -O date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\" https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\". This did the same things as the command used in task 5 but the name of the file was swapped to the current hour/data (formatted into YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.json) by swapping out \"weather.json\" with \"date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\"\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 7: Write the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 7 invovled writing a bash script to automate process 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, a script file called \"weather.sh\" was created in the root repository. Two lines of code were included in this. The first of these was \"#! /bin/bash\". This let the file know that the following script was to be interpreted and run by the bash shell. The second was the command \"wget -O data/weather/`date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.json\"` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\". This was the bash code that actually generated the new files and it was largely the same as that used for task 6, though it had to be altered slightly to faciliate automation: \"data/weather/\" was included afer \"-0\", so that the code knew where to save the file it generated, and this in turn meant that filename had to be put in backticks, so that the code knew to generate a new file with this as the file name.
